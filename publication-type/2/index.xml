      <title>Automatic Generation of Web Censorship Probe Lists</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain probe lists&amp;mdash;used to determine which URLs to probe for Web
censorship&amp;mdash;play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement
studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the
set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an
incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous
efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or
crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does
not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists
that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement.
We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing
test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new
candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing
topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a
feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147
domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each
URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four
months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship.
Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains&amp;mdash;not
present in the original dataset&amp;mdash;we suspect to be blocked. In short,
automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further
automate censorship measurements at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toward Automated DNS Tampering Detection Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2024_foci/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS manipulation is one of the most prevalent and effective techniques for
censoring Internet access and interfering with users&amp;rsquo; online activities
worldwide. Reliable detection of DNS tampering is crucial, but challenging
due to evolving censorship tactics and the lack of complete ground truth
data. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of machine learning (ML) in
addressing these challenges by applying supervised and unsupervised models
to recent global DNS measurement data collected by the Open Observatory of
Network Interference (OONI). Our models achieve high accuracy in learning
expert-defined heuristics for DNS tampering and uncovering new manipulation
instances missed by rule-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through an extensive analysis evaluating different training data volumes
and time windows from one to 24 months, we provide key insights into how
the quantity and diversity of data, as well as evolving censorship
behaviors, impact model performance over time. Remarkably, our ML detector
can enhance traditional heuristics by accurately identifying DNS
fingerprints with high confidence. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of ML techniques in detecting global DNS manipulation at
scale while adapting to emerging censorship tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To foster future research, we will release our regularly updated models,
enabling the development of robust, sustainable censorship detection
systems capable of withstanding the dynamic landscape of Internet
censorship worldwide. Our work paves the way for more proactive
interventions that safeguard Internet freedom globally.&lt;/p&gt;
