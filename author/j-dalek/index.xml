      <title>GFWeb: Measuring the Great Firewall&#39;s Web Censorship at Scale</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship systems such as the Great Firewall (GFW) have been continuously
refined to enhance their filtering capabilities. However, most prior
studies, and in particular the GFW, have been limited in scope and
conducted over short time periods, leading to gaps in our understanding of
the GFW&amp;rsquo;s evolving Web censorship mechanisms over time. We introduce GFWeb,
a novel system designed to discover domain blocklists used by the GFW for
censoring Web access. GFWeb exploits GFW&amp;rsquo;s bidirectional and loss-tolerant
blocking behavior to enable testing hundreds of millions of domains on a
monthly basis, thereby facilitating large-scale longitudinal measurement of
HTTP and HTTPS blocking mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 20 months, GFWeb has tested a total of 1.02 billion
domains, and detected 943K and 55K pay-level domains censored by the GFW&amp;rsquo;s
HTTP and HTTPS filters, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our
study represents the most extensive set of domains censored by the GFW ever
discovered to date, many of which have never been detected by prior
systems. Analyzing the longitudinal dataset collected by GFWeb, we observe
that the GFW has been upgraded to mitigate several issues previously
identified by the research community, including overblocking and failure in
reassembling fragmented packets. More importantly, we discover that the
GFW&amp;rsquo;s bidirectional blocking is not symmetric as previously thought, i.e.,
it can only be triggered by certain domains when probed from inside the
country. We discuss the implications of our work on existing censorship
measurement and circumvention efforts. We hope insights gained from our
study can help inform future research, especially in monitoring censorship
and developing new evasion tools.&lt;/p&gt;
