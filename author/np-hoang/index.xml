      <title>Is Nobody There? Good! Globally Measuring Connection Tampering without Responsive Endhosts</title>
      <link>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2025-sp-mint/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many techniques have been introduced to measure network interference-tampering
performed by nation-state censors or corporate firewalls to block unwanted
traffic. However, virtually all prior measurement techniques require some degree
of participation from endpoints within each country of study: including VPNs,
cloud providers, or volunteers willing to run measurement software on their
personal devices at their own risk. However, such endpoints are not always
available in all countries that tamper with connections, leaving many networks
unmeasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present the first global, active, network interference
measurements that require no participating end-points within any country of
study. Our techniques extend two recent studies that use packet sequences that
trigger network interference from outside the country of study by tricking
middleboxes into believing a connection exists. Our system, Mint, generalizes
and automates this approach-which had previously only been applied to two
countries-to allow it to apply to the global IPv4 and IPv6 Internet. We use Mint
to conduct the first global measurements of network interference without using
any participating endpoints, and the first comprehensive scans of IPv6
interference. We show that we are able to measure networks, autonomous systems,
and even entire countries that previous methods could not. We also present
several case studies that highlight how our tool can be used to perform new
measurement studies of network interference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GFWeb: Measuring the Great Firewall&#39;s Web Censorship at Scale</title>
      <link>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2024_usenixsec_gfweb/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2024_usenixsec_gfweb/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Censorship systems such as the Great Firewall (GFW) have been continuously
refined to enhance their filtering capabilities. However, most prior
studies, and in particular the GFW, have been limited in scope and
conducted over short time periods, leading to gaps in our understanding of
the GFW&amp;rsquo;s evolving Web censorship mechanisms over time. We introduce GFWeb,
a novel system designed to discover domain blocklists used by the GFW for
censoring Web access. GFWeb exploits GFW&amp;rsquo;s bidirectional and loss-tolerant
blocking behavior to enable testing hundreds of millions of domains on a
monthly basis, thereby facilitating large-scale longitudinal measurement of
HTTP and HTTPS blocking mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 20 months, GFWeb has tested a total of 1.02 billion
domains, and detected 943K and 55K pay-level domains censored by the GFW&amp;rsquo;s
HTTP and HTTPS filters, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our
study represents the most extensive set of domains censored by the GFW ever
discovered to date, many of which have never been detected by prior
systems. Analyzing the longitudinal dataset collected by GFWeb, we observe
that the GFW has been upgraded to mitigate several issues previously
identified by the research community, including overblocking and failure in
reassembling fragmented packets. More importantly, we discover that the
GFW&amp;rsquo;s bidirectional blocking is not symmetric as previously thought, i.e.,
it can only be triggered by certain domains when probed from inside the
country. We discuss the implications of our work on existing censorship
measurement and circumvention efforts. We hope insights gained from our
study can help inform future research, especially in monitoring censorship
and developing new evasion tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Automatic Generation of Web Censorship Probe Lists</title>
      <link>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2024_popets/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domain probe lists&amp;mdash;used to determine which URLs to probe for Web
censorship&amp;mdash;play a critical role in Internet censorship measurement
studies. Indeed, the size and accuracy of the domain probe list limits the
set of censored pages that can be detected; inaccurate lists can lead to an
incomplete view of the censorship landscape or biased results. Previous
efforts to generate domain probe lists have been mostly manual or
crowdsourced. This approach is time-consuming, prone to errors, and does
not scale well to the ever-changing censorship landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore methods for automatically generating probe lists
that are both comprehensive and up-to-date for Web censorship measurement.
We start from an initial set of 139,957 unique URLs from various existing
test lists consisting of pages from a variety of languages to generate new
candidate pages. By analyzing content from these URLs (i.e., performing
topic and keyword extraction), expanding these topics, and using them as a
feed to search engines, our method produces 119,255 new URLs across 35,147
domains. We then test the new candidate pages by attempting to access each
URL from servers in eleven different global locations over a span of four
months to check for their connectivity and potential signs of censorship.
Our measurements reveal that our method discovered over 1,400 domains&amp;mdash;not
present in the original dataset&amp;mdash;we suspect to be blocked. In short,
automatically updating probe lists is possible, and can help further
automate censorship measurements at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Toward Automated DNS Tampering Detection Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2024_foci/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNS manipulation is one of the most prevalent and effective techniques for
censoring Internet access and interfering with users&amp;rsquo; online activities
worldwide. Reliable detection of DNS tampering is crucial, but challenging
due to evolving censorship tactics and the lack of complete ground truth
data. In this paper, we demonstrate the power of machine learning (ML) in
addressing these challenges by applying supervised and unsupervised models
to recent global DNS measurement data collected by the Open Observatory of
Network Interference (OONI). Our models achieve high accuracy in learning
expert-defined heuristics for DNS tampering and uncovering new manipulation
instances missed by rule-based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through an extensive analysis evaluating different training data volumes
and time windows from one to 24 months, we provide key insights into how
the quantity and diversity of data, as well as evolving censorship
behaviors, impact model performance over time. Remarkably, our ML detector
can enhance traditional heuristics by accurately identifying DNS
fingerprints with high confidence. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of ML techniques in detecting global DNS manipulation at
scale while adapting to emerging censorship tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To foster future research, we will release our regularly updated models,
enabling the development of robust, sustainable censorship detection
systems capable of withstanding the dynamic landscape of Internet
censorship worldwide. Our work paves the way for more proactive
interventions that safeguard Internet freedom globally.&lt;/p&gt;
