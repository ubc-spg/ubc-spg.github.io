Consequently, it is challenging for serverless tenants to protect their application data from inadvertent leaks due to bugs, misconfigurations, and human errors. Cloud security tools, such as Identity and Access Management (IAM), lack observability into a tenant’s application, whereas the state-of-the-art dataflow tracking tools require support from the cloud platform and incur significant runtime overheads. We present Growlithe, a tool that integrates with the serverless application development toolchain and enables continuous compliance with data policies by design. Growlithe allows declarative specification of access and data flow control policies over a language- and platformindependent dataflow graph abstraction of a serverless application, and enforces these policies through a combination of static analysis and runtime enforcement. We used Growlithe with applications using Python and JavaScript functions that can be hosted on AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions platforms. We empirically demonstrate that Growlithe is crosscutting, portable and efficient, and enables developers to easily adapt their application and policies to evolving requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Growlithe: A Developer-Centric Compliance Tool for Serverless Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Tholoniat","K Kostopoulou","M Chowdhury","A Cidon","R Geambasu","M Lécuyer","J Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1743292800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1743292800,"objectID":"16315cd4ba0054c5d7cebb5c2fdd3f3a","permalink":"https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2025-eurosys/","publishdate":"2025-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-eurosys/","section":"publication","summary":"Machine learning (ML) models can leak information about users, and differential privacy (DP) provides a rigorous way to bound that leakage under a given budget. This DP budget can be regarded as a new type of computing resource in workloads of multiple ML models training on user data. Once it is used, the DP budget is forever consumed. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate it most efficiently to train as many models as possible. This paper presents a scheduler for the privacy resources that optimizes for efficiency. We formulate privacy scheduling as a new type of multidimensional knapsack problem, called privacy knapsack, which maximizes DP budget efficiency. We show that privacy knapsack is NP-hard, hence practical algorithms are necessarily approximate. We develop an approximation algorithm for privacy knapsack, DPack, and evaluate it on microbenchmarks and on a new, synthetic private-ML workload we developed from the Alibaba ML cluster trace. We show that DPack: (1) often approaches the efficiency-optimal schedule, (2) consistently schedules more tasks compared to a state-of-the-art privacy scheduling algorithm that focused on fairness instead of efficiency (1.3-1.7× in Alibaba, 1.0-2.6X in microbenchmarks), but (3) sacrifices some level of fairness for efficiency. Using DPack, DP ML operators should be able to train more models on the same amount of user data while offering the same privacy guarantee to their users.","tags":null,"title":"DPack: Efficiency-Oriented Privacy Budget Scheduling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["B Jiang","T Bilot","N El Madhoun","K Al Agha","A Zouaoui","S Iqbal","X Han","T Pasquier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1736640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1736640000,"objectID":"fbcc5da5c0c98744051c5293c427438b","permalink":"https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2025-usenixsec/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2025-usenixsec/","section":"publication","summary":"Past success in applying machine learning to data provenance graphs -- a structured representation of the history of operating system activities -- to detect host system intrusions has fueled continued interest in the security community. Recent solutions, particularly anomaly-based approaches using graph neural networks (GNNs) to detect previously unknown attacks, have reported near-perfect accuracy. Surprisingly, despite this high performance, the industry remains reluctant to adopt these intrusion detection systems (IDSs). We identify Quality of Attribution (QoA) as the key factor contributing to this disconnect. QoA refers to the amount of effort required from a human analyst to investigate an IDS's detection output, uncover the root causes of an attack, understand its ramifications, and dismiss potential false alarms. Unfortunately, prior work often generates large volumes of low-QoA output, much of which is irrelevant to attack activities, leading to alert fatigue and analyst burnout. We introduce Orthrus, the first IDS to achieve high-QoA detection on data provenance graphs at the node level.

It then reconstructs the attack path through dependency analysis to ensure high-QoA detection. We compare Orthrus against five state-of-the-art IDSs.

Meanwhile, incessant discoveries of memory safety vulnerabilities have left the systems community with no choice but to disallow unprivileged eBPF programs, which unfortunately limits eBPF use to only privileged users. To improve run-time safety of the framework, we introduce SafeBPF, a general design that isolates eBPF programs from the rest of the kernel to prevent memory safety vulnerabilities from being exploited. We present a pure software implementation using a Software-based Fault Isolation (SFI) approach and a hardware assisted implementation that leverages ARM’s Memory Tagging Extension (MTE).

To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the most extensive set of domains censored by the GFW ever discovered to date, many of which have never been detected by prior systems. Analyzing the longitudinal dataset collected by GFWeb, we observe that the GFW has been upgraded to mitigate several issues previously identified by the research community, including overblocking and failure in reassembling fragmented packets. More importantly, we discover that the GFW’s bidirectional blocking is not symmetric as previously thought, i.e., it can only be triggered by certain domains when probed from inside the country.

Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to analyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing particularly on advanced persistent threats.

We present KAIROS, the first PIDS that simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas existing approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable detection performance. Kairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's structural changes to quantify the degree of *anomalousness* for each system event. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack footprints, generating compact *summary graphs* that accurately describe malicious activity over a *stream* of system audit logs.

We present UNICORN, an anomaly-based APT detector that effectively leverages data provenance analysis. From modeling to detection, UNICORN tailors its design specifically for the unique characteristics of APTs. Through extensive yet time-efficient graph analysis, UNICORN explores provenance graphs that provide rich contextual and historical information to identify stealthy anomalous activities without pre-defined attack signatures. Using a graph sketching technique, it summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency to combat slow-acting attacks that take place over a long time span. UNICORN further improves its detection capability using a novel modeling approach to understand long-term behavior as the system evolves. Our evaluation shows that UNICORN outperforms an existing state-of-the-art APT detection system and detects real-life APT scenarios with high accuracy.","tags":null,"title":"UNICORN: Runtime Provenance-Based Detector for Advanced Persistent Threats","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Pasquier","X Han","T Moyer","A Bates","O Hermant","D Eyers","J Bacon","M Seltzer"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1539561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539561600,"objectID":"d727e5daf611e690ebe372bc0192d3f6","permalink":"https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2018-ccs/","publishdate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-ccs/","section":"publication","summary":"Identifying the root cause and impact of a system intrusion remains a foundational challenge in computer security. Digital provenance provides a detailed history of the flow of information within a computing system, connecting suspicious events to their root causes. Although existing provenance-based auditing techniques provide value in forensic analysis, they assume that such analysis takes place only retrospectively. Such post-hoc analysis is insufficient for realtime security applications; moreover, even for forensic tasks, prior provenance collection systems exhibited poor performance and scalability, jeopardizing the timeliness of query responses. We present CamQuery, which provides inline, realtime provenance analysis, making it suitable for implementing security applications. CamQuery is a Linux Security Module that offers support for both userspace and in-kernel execution of analysis applications. We demonstrate the applicability of CamQuery to a variety of runtime security applications including data loss prevention, intrusion detection, and regulatory compliance. In evaluation, we demonstrate that CamQuery reduces the latency of realtime query mechanisms, while imposing minimal overheads on system execution. CamQuery thus enables the further deployment of provenance-based technologies to address central challenges in computer security.","tags":null,"title":"Runtime Analysis of Whole-System Provenance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T Pasquier","X Han","M Goldstein","T Moyer","D Eyers","M Seltzer","J Bacon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1506297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506297600,"objectID":"07f632907fed6a8aade00e2f45948e44","permalink":"https://spg.cs.ubc.ca/publication/2017-socc/","publishdate":"2017-09-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-socc/","section":"publication","summary":"Data provenance describes how data came to be in its present form. It includes data sources and the transformations that have been applied to them. Data provenance has many uses, from forensics and security to aiding the reproducibility of scientific experiments. We present CamFlow, a whole-system provenance capture mechanism that integrates easily into a PaaS offering. While there have been several prior whole-system provenance systems that captured a comprehensive, systemic and ubiquitous record of a system’s behavior, none have been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B) are designed for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port to current systems, C) generate too much data, or D) are designed for a single system. CamFlow addresses these shortcoming by: 1) leveraging the latest kernel design advances to achieve efficiency; 2) using a self-contained, easily maintainable implementation relying on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured provenance data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to integrate provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture is streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We illustrate the usability of our implementation by describing three such applications: demonstrating compliance with data regulations; performing fault/intrusion detection; and implementing data loss prevention. We also show how CamFlow can be leveraged to capture meaningful provenance without modifying existing applications.","tags":null,"title":"Practical Whole-System Provenance Capture","type":"publication"}]
